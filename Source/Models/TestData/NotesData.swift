    Notes(title: "Why are we here, just to suffer", body: "I have not tasted candy in a while tbh."),
    Notes(title: "How this is going to go?", body: "This app business is a bit tough, but the whole puzzle solving stuff is really attractive. That being said there are some frustrating days, where I feel like this is my limit, can't go ahead with it. Then I find the limitation was the method I was pursuing. Then I get positive vibes as in, at least there are ton more ways to find the solution and I have definitely eliminated one of them. Cheers!"),
    Notes(title: "Porn version of Matrix", body: "I wonder what would be the plot of such parody would be? Smith on the heroin action? That would be interesting."),
    Notes(title: "Filling the cells", body: "So I was wondering when would I find time to fill up placeholder data to test my UI and code, then I realised I can do it while I'm depressed or when I take a break day, which is today. Funny isn't it? No one would when 'today' is? I have to code the computer to let it record the time for the note."),
    Notes(title: "What is a plaboy?", body: "I have no idea, but I'm certainly not one."),
    Notes(title: "I missed a 'y' in previous note", body: "hehe"),
    Notes(title: "I wonder what someone would think if they find this test data?", body: "Would they think if this is a conspiracy and will it show up on youtube channels like night mind? I don't know, but it would be really interesting to see in the future, where all this code ends up.")
